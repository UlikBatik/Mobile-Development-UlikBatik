<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Our app is designed to preserve and promote Indonesia's rich batik heritage, recognized by UNESCO as a crucial cultural asset. Aimed at Gen Z, the app combines advanced pattern recognition technology and a recommender system with social media features to both educate and engage users. By connecting users with marketplaces and showcasing modern batik trends, the app aligns traditional art with contemporary lifestyles. This approach supports the National Economic Recovery initiative and empowers a new generation to embrace and sustain this important aspect of Indonesian cultural identity. Our recognition system deciphers the intricate meanings behind batik patterns, while the recommender system personalizes user experiences, ensuring that each interaction is informative and culturally enriching.
